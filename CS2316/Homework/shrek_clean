719,4,3495,False,One of a kind.
720,2,3497,False,Slow down.
721,4,3501,False,"Slow down, baby, please."
722,15,3516,False,I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time.
723,4,3520,False,Just call me old-fashioned.
724,9,3529,False,I don't want to rush into a physical relationship.
725,20,3549,False,"I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for."
726,8,3557,False,"Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact."
727,5,3562,False,"Hey, what are you doing?"
728,2,3564,False,"Okay, okay."
729,14,3578,False,Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time.
730,19,3597,False,I mean we really should get to know each other first as friends or maybe even as pen pals.
731,24,3621,False,"I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that!"
732,3,3624,False,That's my tail!

758,6,3724,False,I am eternally in your debt.
759,11,3735,False,And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?
760,5,3740,False,I hope you heard that.

771,6,3794,False,But how will you kiss me?
772,1,3795,False,What?
773,6,3801,False,That wasn't in the job description.
774,4,3805,False,Maybe it's a perk.
775,3,3808,False,"No, it's destiny."
776,7,3815,False,"Oh, you must know how it goes."
777,25,3840,False,"A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss."
778,1,3841,False,Hmm?
779,2,3843,True,With Shrek?
780,4,3847,False,You think- - Wait.

785,4,3869,False,What is so funny?
786,8,3877,False,"Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?"
787,4,3881,False,"Of course, you are."
788,3,3884,False,You're my rescuer.
789,7,3891,False,Now - - Now remove your helmet.
790,1,3892,False,Look.
791,9,3901,False,I really don't think this is a good idea.
792,5,3906,False,Just take off the helmet.
793,4,3910,False,I'm not going to.
794,3,3913,False,Take it off.
795,1,3914,False,No!

806,7,3951,False,You're not supposed to be an ogre.
807,11,3962,False,"Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?"
808,9,3971,False,He is the one who wants to marry you.
809,7,3978,False,Then why didn't he come rescue me?
810,2,3980,False,Good question.
811,9,3989,False,You should ask him that when we get there.
812,19,4008,False,"But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his -- his pet."
813,6,4014,False,"Well, so much for noble steed."
814,7,4021,False,You're not making my job any easier.
815,9,4030,False,"I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem."
816,20,4050,False,"You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here."
817,1,4051,False,Hey!
818,7,4058,False,"I'm no one's messenger boy, all right?"
819,4,4062,False,I'm a delivery boy.

827,3,4092,False,Put me down!
828,5,4097,False,"Okay, so here's another question."
829,16,4113,False,"Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way."
830,24,4137,False,"Now how do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?"
831,4,4141,False,How you do that?
832,9,4150,False,You just tell her she's not your true love.
833,8,4158,False,Everyone knowest what happens when you find your
834,1,4159,False,Hey!
835,8,4167,False,The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
836,6,4173,False,"You're gonna love it there, Princess."
837,2,4175,False,It's beautiful!
838,5,4180,False,And what of my groom-to-be?
839,2,4182,False,Lord Farquaad?
840,3,4185,False,What's he like?
841,7,4192,False,"Let me put it this way, Princess."
842,8,4200,False,Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
843,2,4202,True,"No, Shrek."
844,8,4210,False,There are those who think little of him!
845,2,4212,False,Stop it.
846,5,4217,False,"Stop it, both of you."
847,17,4234,False,"You know, you're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad."
848,6,4240,False,"Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess."
849,12,4252,False,"But I'll let you do the ""measuring"" when you see him tomorrow."
850,4,4256,False,The sun is setting.
851,1,4257,False,Tomorrow?
852,4,4261,False,It'll take that long?
853,6,4267,False,Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
854,4,4271,False,"No, that'll take longer."
855,4,4275,False,We can keep going.
856,6,4281,False,But there's robbers in the woods.
857,1,4282,False,Whoa!
858,3,4285,True,"Time out, Shrek!"
859,7,4292,False,Camp is definitely starting to sound good.
860,3,4295,False,"Hey, come on."
861,11,4306,False,I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.
862,8,4314,False,I need to find somewhere to camp now!
863,1,4315,False,Hey!
864,2,4317,False,Over here.
865,7,4324,True,"Shrek, we can do better than that."
866,9,4333,False,I don't think this is fit for a princess.
867,4,4337,False,"No, no, it's perfect."
868,7,4344,False,It just needs a few homey touches.
869,2,4346,False,Homey touches?
870,2,4348,False,Like what?
871,2,4350,False,A door?
872,7,4357,False,"Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night."

879,16,4408,False,"And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields."
880,1,4409,False,Right.
881,1,4410,False,Yeah.
882,9,4419,False,"Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?"
883,7,4426,False,"The stars don't tell the future, Donkey."
884,3,4429,False,They tell stories.
885,5,4434,False,"Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent."
886,7,4441,False,You can guess what he's famous for.
887,6,4447,False,I know you're making this up.
888,2,4449,False,"No, look."
889,14,4463,False,"There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench."
890,9,4472,False,That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
891,10,4482,False,"You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear."
892,1,4483,False,Hmm?
893,2,4485,False,Forget it.
894,12,4497,True,"Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?"

900,6,4521,False,There's just me and my swamp.
901,14,4535,False,The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.
902,5,4540,True,"You cut me deep, Shrek."
903,7,4547,False,You cut me real deep just now.
904,6,4553,False,"Hey, you know what I think?"
905,14,4567,False,I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
906,4,4571,False,"No, do ya think?"
907,4,4575,False,Are you hidin' something?
908,3,4578,False,"Never mind, Donkey."

910,11,4600,False,"No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things."
911,8,4608,False,Why don't you want to talk about it?
912,8,4616,False,Why do you want to talk about it?
913,4,4620,False,Why are you blocking?
914,3,4623,False,I'm not blocking.

925,9,4669,False,"What you got against the whole world anyway, huh?"
926,9,4678,False,"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay?"
927,11,4689,False,It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.
928,8,4697,False,People take one look at me and go.
